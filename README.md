# SageToEmby
Python Script to Symlink SageTV Files to Emby Format

This is a very kludgy script to create symlinks for SageTV shows into Emby/Kodi format. It is not effecient, but it works.

It uses SageX api to get the show name, because parsing filenames is not very good.
Edit the directories to your liking. You need to create the top level directories yourself. Also edit your Sage IP address
